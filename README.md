# Linear-Regression
This repository contains Linear Regression Implementation file which is coded in R and Data Set.
Problem Statement: Predict the car MPG value based on other paramaters like cylinders, displacement, horsepower etc.. 
This is a small data set which contains 398 observations and 9 paramaters including a target varibale(MPG).
In our approach, we have followed the below steps to build the model and then testing the model.
1) Read The Data 
2) Exploratory Data Analysis
	   a) Understanding the structure of the data
	   b) Univariate Analysis (Dependent Variable --MPG)
	   c) Bivariate Analysis (Dependent vs Each independent Variable)
	   d) Objective Bivariate Analysis (Correlation...)
3) Data Pre Processing
	   a) Scaling
	   b) Imputation
	   c) Encoding (Categorical to factors)
4) Splitting the data into training and test sets
5) First Cut Model
6) Test Assumptions (If the model doesn't pass the LINE assumptions, then perform the relative remidiations and build the model and test again) 
7) Data Transformations (Other Technics aswell)
8) Univariate & Bivariate repeat
9) Splitting the data into training and test sets 
10)Second Cut Model
11)Test Assumptions
12)Multicollinearity, Influential Points


LINE Assumptions:
L - Linearity -- Residuals should be linear in nature.
I - Independence -- Residuals must be independent to each other.
N - Normality -- Residuals must be normally distributed.
E - Equal -- Residuals must have equal variance.
